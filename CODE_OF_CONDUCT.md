We have to:
- End apartheid
- Slow down the nuclear arms race
- Stop terrorism and world hunger
- Provide food and shelter for the homeless
- Oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women
- Encourage a return to traditional moral values
- Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people
